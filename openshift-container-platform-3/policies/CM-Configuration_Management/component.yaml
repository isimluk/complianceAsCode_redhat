## CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT
##

# ADMINISTRATORS NOTE ON CM-2:
#       Implimentation of this control varies greatly between customers. Some
#       want centralized config management, while others expect component
#       administrators to handle this (e.g. maintain custom Ansible scripts).
#       In Red Hat's OpenControl content CM-2 is handled at the PMO level,
#       however it's best to double check with the Information System owner
#       on expectations (component vs central CM).
#
#       In case the customer desires components (e.g. OpenShift Admins) to
#       handle configuration management the lines below can be uncommented:

        information system component installations and upgrades. A
        successful control response will need to address updates to the baseline
        configuration as a part of installations and upgrades.'

# ADMINISTRATORS NOTE ON CM-2(2):
#       Implimentation of this control varies between customers. Some create
#       a central configuration management system, while others expect
#       information system components (e.g. OpenShift Adminstrators)
#       to create their own playbooks and store them in the centralized
#       service. Other customers delegate this control entirely to
#       system component administrators.
#
#       If CM-6(1) is selected, which is mandatory for FISMA Moderate and
#       FedRAMP systems, the organization must centrally employ automated
#       mechanisms for configuration management (e.g. Ansible Tower).
#
#       In such cases, a proper response would illistrate how OpenShift
#       administrators will provide configuration management content
#       (e.g. Ansible Playbooks) to the central service (e.g. Ansible
#       Tower).

#       ADMINISTRATORS NOTE ON CM-8:
#       Implimentation of this control varies between customers. Some agencies
#       maintain an inventory that state "OpenShift 3.x," whereas others want
#       named RPMs installed on the OpenShift components. The vast majority
#       follow the "OpenShift 3.x" listings. For those that do not, and want
#       complete listings of underlying RPMs, the following section should be
#       uncommented and updated.
#
#       If Satellite is managing the OpenShift nodes, documenting how OpenShift
#       components integrate into Satellite for centralized inventory management
#       is perfectly acceptable.
